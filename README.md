# MyProfile

# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Marcel (Nebirr)

I'm a passionate developer focused on building intelligent desktop applications  
and experimenting with automation, user interfaces, and AI integration.

ðŸ”§ **Tech Stack**
- Python (PySide6, PyInstaller, PowerShell, Inno Setup)
- C++ (currently learning for camera control systems and low-level automation)
- Git, GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines

ðŸš€ **Featured Project**
### [Atlas AI](https://github.com/Nebirr/Atlas-KI)
A Windows desktop assistant built with PySide6.  
It includes a modern GUI, modular intent handling, and a full build pipeline using  
PyInstaller and Inno Setup â€” packaged into a professional Windows installer.

ðŸ§­ **Goals**
- Extend Atlas with offline speech recognition (Vosk)
- Develop custom C++ modules for camera control and hardware interaction
- Continue improving automation, UI design, and system integration skills
